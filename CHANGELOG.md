# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Note: pre-1.0, breaking changes may ship in a minor release.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-25

### Breaking

- `FetchKey` now returns `(*rsa.PublicKey, KeyFlags, string)` — a new `KeyFlags`
  value is inserted before the result string — and takes an additional
  `hashAlg string` parameter (the hash half of the verifying signature's `a=`
  tag). The added return surfaces the selected key record's policy flags so a
  caller can enforce them against the signature: `KeyFlags.NoSubdomain` reflects
  the record's `t=s` no-subdomain flag and `KeyFlags.NotForEmail` reflects a
  restrictive `s=` service-type tag. The added parameter lets `FetchKey` honor
  the record's `h=` acceptable-hash-algorithm tag. Any code calling this exported
  primitive directly — such as a layered scheme (ARC) reusing the key path — must
  update its call site and result destructuring. `Verify` and `VerifySignature`
  are unchanged.

### Fixed

- Validate the DKIM key record's `v=` version tag (RFC 6376 §3.6.1): a record
  must either omit `v=` or set it to `DKIM1` as the very first tag. A record
  whose `v=` names a different version, or places `v=` anywhere but first, is now
  rejected as unusable instead of being parsed as a v1 key. (#30)

- Enforce the key record's `s=` service-type tag (RFC 6376 §3.6.1). When `s=` is
  present and lists neither `email` nor the `*` wildcard, the signer has
  restricted the key to other services, so it is no longer accepted for an email
  signature and the signature PERMFAILs. An absent `s=` still defaults to all
  services. (#29)

- Enforce the key record's `t=s` flag (RFC 6376 §3.6.1), which forbids
  subdomaining. When the flag is set, a signature whose `i=` (AUID) domain is a
  subdomain of `d=` rather than exactly `d=` is now a PERMFAIL. `FetchKey`
  returns the flag to the caller through the new `KeyFlags` type. (#28)

- Require the signature's `v=` version tag (RFC 6376 §3.5): a `DKIM-Signature`
  that omits `v=`, or carries a value other than `1`, is now a PERMFAIL instead
  of being verified as though it were a v1 signature. (#27)

- Require the `From` field in the signed header list when signing (RFC 6376
  §5.4). `Sign` now returns an error rather than producing a signature whose `h=`
  omits `From`, matching the verify-side requirement added in v0.1.3 and
  preventing creation of a signature that leaves the author identity outside the
  hash. (#26)

- Accept RFC-legal unpadded base64 in the `bh=` and `b=` signature tags and the
  key record's `p=` tag (RFC 6376 §2.10). The trailing `=` padding on these
  base64 fields is optional, but a correctly encoded unpadded value was
  previously rejected, failing otherwise-valid signatures. Decoding now tolerates
  missing padding. (#25)

- Enforce the key record's `h=` acceptable-hash-algorithms tag (RFC 6376 §3.6.1
  / §6.1.2). A key record whose `h=` is present but does not list the verifying
  signature's hash algorithm is now skipped, so a key published only for, say,
  `sha256` cannot be used to verify a `sha1` signature. (#24)

## [0.1.3] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed

- Reject a signature whose `h=` signed-header list does not include the `From`
  field. RFC 6376 §5.4 makes `From` mandatory in `h=` and §6.1.1 requires a
  PERMFAIL when it is absent; otherwise the displayed author identity sits
  outside the signed hash and can be altered after signing without breaking the
  signature. Verification now PERMFAILs when `h=` does not cover `From`. (#20)

- Reject a signature whose `i=` (AUID) identity domain is not the signing
  domain (`d=`) or a subdomain of it, per RFC 6376 §6.1.1. An unaligned `i=`
  let a signature that is valid for one domain be presented as authorizing
  another; the domain mismatch is now a PERMFAIL. When `i=` is absent its
  default (`@` + `d=`) is trivially aligned. (#19)

- Reject a DKIM-Signature tag-list, or a DNS key record, that contains a
  duplicate tag name. RFC 6376 §3.2 declares such a list invalid, but the
  previous last-wins parse silently kept one value, letting two verifiers reach
  different verdicts about the same message. A repeated tag name is now a
  PERMFAIL for a signature and causes a malformed key record to be skipped. (#21)

- Reject an expired signature and malformed signature timing. A signature whose
  `x=` expiration has passed (the current time is at or after `x=`) is treated
  as invalid per RFC 6376 §6.1.1; an `x=` that is not greater than `t=`, and a
  `t=` or `x=` that is not a 1–12 digit epoch-second count, are PERMFAILs rather
  than being silently ignored. Timestamps are compared as 64-bit values so the
  expiry check stays correct beyond 2038 on 32-bit platforms. (#22)

### Added

- Export `ParseTagListStrict`, a strict sibling of `ParseTagList` that enforces
  the RFC 6376 §3.2 well-formedness rules — no duplicate tag names, no segment
  missing `=`, no empty tag name — and returns an error instead of silently
  resolving a malformed list to an arbitrary value. Layered schemes such as ARC
  can reuse it on the verification path. (#21)

## [0.1.2] - 2026-07-25

### Security

- Reject a non-digit `l=` body-length tag during verification, fixing a remotely
  triggerable panic (DoS). `VerifySignature` parsed the `l=` tag with
  `strconv.Atoi`, which accepts a leading sign, so a `DKIM-Signature` carrying
  `l=-1` parsed to `-1` and then sliced the canonicalized body with a negative
  bound (`canonBody[:-1]`), panicking with `slice bounds out of range [:-1]`.
  Because the signature header is fully attacker-controlled and this fired before
  any cryptographic check, an unauthenticated sender could crash any process that
  called `Verify`/`VerifySignature` on inbound mail. `parseUint` now enforces the
  RFC 6376 §3.5 ABNF (`sig-l-tag = ... 1*76DIGIT`), rejecting any value that is
  not composed solely of ASCII digits — including a leading `+` or `-` — as a
  PERMFAIL. (#16, #17)

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-23

### Changed

- Rename the module path to `github.com/rest-mail/go-dkim`, standardizing on the
  `go-*` naming convention shared with the wider ecosystem. The package
  identifier stays `package dkim`; only the module path and repository changed.
  (#2)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- Initial release: RFC 6376 DKIM message signing and verification with no
  external dependencies. Signs with `rsa-sha256` and verifies `rsa-sha256` and
  legacy `rsa-sha1`; supports both simple and relaxed header and body
  canonicalization over the raw RFC 5322 message bytes; generates keypairs and
  renders DNS TXT records; reports RFC 8601 result values; accepts a pluggable
  DNS resolver; and exports the canonicalization primitives so layered schemes
  such as ARC can reuse the exact same code path.
